function complexity = tid_psam_hjorth_complexity_TD(signal)
% tid_psam_hjorth_complexity_TD - Computes the Hjorth Complexicty.
%
% Usage:
%   tid_psam_hjorth_complexity_TD(data)
%
% Inputs:
%   data - a numerical array [1-by-1], [Channels-by-1] or [Channels-by-Epochs]
%
% Outputs:
%   complexity - the Hjorth Complexity [1-by-1], [Channels-by-1] or [Channels-by-Epochs]
%
% The Hjorth Mobility is defined as the square root of variance of first derivative divided by variance of the signal.
%   For details, see Alawee et al. (2023). 
%   Note: In this implementation, variance is consistently calculated using 'n' as the denominator, 
%   rather than 'n - 1' as suggested by Alawee et al. (2023). 
%   Alawee et al. (2023) are inconsistent regarding whether 'n' or 'n - 1' 
%   should be used. Here, we adopt the use of 'n' throughout for consistency.
